# Solve
This challenge was very easy. We just look through the different pages until we find `http://fun.ritsec.club:8007/Stars.html` where we find the base64 encoded flag `UklUU0VDe0FSM19ZMFVfRjMzNzFOR18xVF9OMFdfTVJfS1I0QjU/IX0=`.

Decode it and we get `RITSEC{AR3_Y0U_F3371NG_1T_N0W_MR_KR4B5?!}`.

Note: We also get a hint for the last web challenge, `Lazy Dev`.
